# Soul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Project
Soul Bike Sharing Demand Project

Research on bike-sharing systems highlights the influence of environmental, temporal, and 
contextual factors on demand. Faghih-Imani et al. (2017) found temperature, precipitation, and 
proximity to transit significantly impact bike usage, while Gebhart and Noland (2014) 
emphasized time of day and user demographics. Predictive models, such as regression and 
machine learning methods, have demonstrated their utility. Li et al. (2015) validated regression 
models for meteorological impacts, and Wang et al. (2018) showed Random Forest and GBM 
excel at capturing complex patterns, a strength reflected in our use of XGBoost.
Studies like Kim et al. (2020) focus on Seoul, identifying parallels with global trends, such as 
higher demand during favorable weather and peak hours. These insights, combined with 
predictive analytics, aid in system optimization by improving resource allocation and enhancing 
user satisfaction.

Abstract:
The Seoul Bike Sharing system plays a key role in promoting sustainable urban mobility. This 
project analyzes the factors influencing bike-sharing demand and develops predictive models for 
demand forecasting. Using a comprehensive dataset, we explored how variables such as weather, 
temporal patterns, and holidays affect bike rental counts. Data preprocessing involved feature 
engineering for time-based attributes and dummy variable creation for categorical factors. We 
applied regression techniques, including multiple linear regression and regularized models 
(LASSO, Ridge), along with machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost. 
Exploratory Data Analysis revealed strong correlations between demand and temperature, rush 
hour usage, and seasonal effects. The best-performing model achieved a significant reduction in 
forecasting errors (15%) compared to baseline linear models, demonstrating the effectiveness of 
data-driven approaches in urban mobility planning.
